"""
The code uses the Counter class from the collections module to count the frequency of each element in the list, 
and then uses the most_common() method to return a list of tuples containing the elements and their frequencies, 
sorted in descending order of frequency. The code then iterates over this list and appends the elements with the highest frequency to a list m. 
Finally, if m has only one element, z is assigned that element. Otherwise, m is sorted in ascending order, and the second smallest element is assigned to z.
